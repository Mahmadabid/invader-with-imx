## Metadata Refresh 
Metadata Refresh is done to update ships and to add more NFTs to the contracts.

Metadata Refresh is being done in two ways.

#### Automatic Metadata Refresh
When the ship is upgraded using [api](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/api/upgrade.ts) through inventory page. The NFT metadata is also updated using immutable ```refreshNFTMetadata()``` function.

#### Manual Metadata Refresh 
Metadata Refresh is also done manually. Metadata files are generated by ```generateFiles.ts``` of each contract.

Move to root folder. Do this for all commands in [nftData Folder](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/tree/master/src/nftData). In [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/tsconfig.json) make sure to replace ```"module": "esnext",``` with ```"module": "commonjs",```
```
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/FolderName/generateFile.ts
```
Replace FolderName with the name of folder:
```
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/ship/generateFile.ts
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/timer/generateFile.ts
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/health/generateFile.ts
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/teleport/generateFile.ts
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/firing/generateFile.ts
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/enemyFiring/generateFile.ts
```

Fire Powerups Contract [generateFiles.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/firing/generateFile.ts). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Health Powerups Contract [generateFiles.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/health/generateFile.ts). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Teleport Powerups Contract [generateFiles.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/teleport/generateFile.ts). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Timer Powerups Contract [generateFiles.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/timer/generateFile.ts). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Enemy Fire Powerups Contract [generateFiles.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/enemyFiring/generateFile.ts). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Ships Contract [generateFiles.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/ship/generateFile.ts). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and the tokenID and their Level and generates their files by their level to upgrade Ships to Level 2, 3 and 4 and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Metadata is Refreshed using ```metadataRefresh.ts``` of each contract, [Ship](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/ship/metadataRefresh.ts), [Fire](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/firing/metadataRefresh.ts), [Enemy Fire](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/enemyFiring/metadataRefresh.ts), [Health](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/health/metadataRefresh.ts), [Timer](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/timer/metadataRefresh.ts), [Teleport](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/teleport/metadataRefresh.ts)

Use this command
```
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node src/nftData/FolderName/metadataRefresh.ts
```

#### Post Mint Refresh
For ship contract NFT are upgraded so NFTs metadata is refreshed using [postMintRefresh.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/ship/postMintRefresh.ts). This upgrades the NFT for next Levels. It fetches the IDs and their Levels form ship smart contract and updates the metadata of upgraded NFTs.

Use this command
```
./node_modules/.bin/ts-node ship/metadataRefresh.ts
```


## Checkout
Checkout is used to bridge Ether from Ethereum to Immutable Zkevm. Currently it bridges sepolia to immutable zkevm testnet. You can bridge IMX directly to immutable Passport wallet. It also enables the option to swap tokens supported by checkout.

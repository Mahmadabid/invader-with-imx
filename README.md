- pinata

## Immutable zkevm
Following Products of immutable zkevm were used

- Immutable Passport
- Metadata Refresh 
- @imtb/sdk
- ERC721Client
- burn
- transfer
- ERC721 contracts

## Metadata Refresh 
Metadata Refresh is being done in two ways.

### Automatic Metadata Refresh
Metadata Refresh is done to update ships and to add more NFTs to the contracts.

When the ship is upgraded using [api](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/api/upgrade.ts) through inventory page. The NFT metadata is also updated using immutable ```refreshNFTMetadata()``` function.

### Manual Metadata Refresh 
Metadata Refresh is also done manually. Metadata files are generated by ```generateFiles.js``` of each contract.

Fire Powerups Contract [generateFiles.js](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/firing/generateFile.js). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Health Powerups Contract [generateFiles.js](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/health/generateFile.js). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Timer Powerups Contract [generateFiles.js](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/timer/generateFile.js). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and generate their files and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Ships Contract [generateFiles.js](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/ship/generateFile.js). It fetches the total number of NFTs minted and the tokenID and their Level and generates their files by their level to upgrade Ships to Level 2 and add additional 50 files to accomodate new players.

Metadata is Refreshed using ```metadataRefresh.ts``` of each contract, [Ship](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/ship/metadataRefresh.ts), [Fire](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/firing/metadataRefresh.ts), [Health](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/health/metadataRefresh.ts), [Timer](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/timer/metadataRefresh.ts)

#### Post Mint Refresh
For ship contract NFT are upgraded so NFTs metadata is refreshed using [postMintRefresh.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/nftData/ship/postMintRefresh.ts). This upgrades the NFT for next Levels. It fetches the IDs and their Levels form ship smart contract and updates the metadata of upgraded NFTs.

## Smart Contracts
[Code](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/tree/master/smartContracts)

### IPX Smart Contract 
[Code](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/smartContracts/contracts/GameToken.sol)

## Pages

### 1. Game
[Code](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/index.tsx)

This page fetches user ship. If ship not found it mints the ship without user paying any gas fee using [api](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/api/mintNFT.ts). It fetches the powerups and Level of user and adds powerups and increases the Level of the player using ```getNftByCollection()``` function from [immutable.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/utils/immutable.ts). The user can then start the game. After winning the game user receives points and $IPX using [api](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/api/data.ts) which the user can claim.

### 2. Inventory
[Code](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/inventory.tsx)

This page lists NFTs related to Pixels Invader Collections using blockchainData funtions ```getNftByAddress(address)``` added in [immutable.ts](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/utils/immutable.ts) file using ```@imtbl/sdk```.

It then grants option to **burn** and **transfer** and for ship to **upgrade**(Which upgrades the ship level, without user paying any gas fee using [api](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/api/upgrade.ts)). All these functions are created using ```@imtbl/sdk```.

### 3. Market
[Code](https://github.com/Mahmadabid/invader-with-imx/blob/master/src/pages/market.tsx)

This page allows users to buy Powerups NFTs using $IPX. The market burns $IPX and mints NFTS. The NFT powerups will be provide boost to players to help them win.
